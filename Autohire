 1. Project Title :
AutoHire: Multi-Agent AI for Smart Recruitment

2. Overview / Problem Statement:
Recruiters often spend hours manually going through job descriptions and candidate resumes, which is slow and error-prone.
Our project solves this problem by creating a multi-agent AI system that:
- Reads and summarizes job descriptions
- Extracts key information from resumes
- Matches candidates to job requirements
- Automatically shortlists and schedules interviews

3. Project Architecture :
This project uses 4 AI agents:
- JD Summarizer Agent: Extracts key skills and requirements from job descriptions.
-  Resume Parser Agent: Extracts education, experience, and skills from CVs.
- Matching Agent: Calculates match scores based on JD and CV comparison.
-  Interview Scheduler Agent: Sends interview invites to shortlisted candidates.

4. Tech Stack:
- Language: Python
- NLP: spaCy, NLTK, HuggingFace Transformers (BERT)
- CV Parsing: pyresparser, pdfminer, docx2txt
- Database: SQLite (for storing JDs, CVs, match scores)
- Emailing: smtplib, email module (Python)
- Optional UI: Streamlit / Flask (for demo)
